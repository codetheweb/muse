Muse is a self-hosted Discord music bot. It's made for small to medium-sized Discord servers.

### Features

- üé• Livestreams
- ‚è© Seeking within a song/video
- üíæ Local caching for better performance
- üìã No vote-to-skip - this is anarchy, not a democracy
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è Autoconverts playlists / artists / albums / songs from Spotify
- ‚ÜóÔ∏è Users can add custom shortcuts (aliases)
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Muse instance supports multiple guilds
- ‚úçÔ∏è Written in TypeScript, easily extendable

### Design Philosophy

I believe it makes much more sense to let Discord handle user permissions (whenever possible) rather than building them into a bot and adding additional complexity. Instead of only allowing users with a certain role to control Muse, Muse allows anyone who has access to its bound channel to control it. Instead of specifying the owner as a user ID in the config, Muse simply looks at the guild owner.

### Running

Muse is written in TypeScript. You can either run Muse with Docker (recommended) or directly with Node.js. Both methods require API keys passed in as environment variables:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` can be acquired [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) by creating a 'New Application', then going to 'Bot'.
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` can be acquired [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) with 'Create a Client ID'.
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` can be acquired by [creating a new project](https://console.developers.google.com) in Google's Developer Console, enabling the YouTube API, and creating an API key under credentials.

Muse will log a URL when run. Open this URL in a browser to invite Muse to your server. Muse will DM the server owner after it's added with setup instructions.

#### Docker

(Replace empty config strings with correct values.)

```bash
docker build -t muse .
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -e DISCORD_TOKEN='' -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='' -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='' -e YOUTUBE_API_KEY='' muse
```
